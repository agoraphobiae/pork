pork
====

A text-adventure inspired by the likes of zork. Development greatly helped by AngelHack SF 2013. Currently in the middle of converting this project to a flask based website, but for now you can run it on your own machine using:
```python game/pork.py```

The game is nowhere near finished, but you can try out what's been completed of the engine by running:
```python game/pork.py```

Python 3.3 is recommended but 2.7 should work.

You can also take a look inside ```game/game.py``` and change the following lines:
``` genGameMap = genGameMap```
to try different maps, although there aren't very many at the the current stage.
